# HAND-GESTURES-DRIVE-ROBOT
this is a computer vision project. we use ML for drive a little BOT

# Dataset

the train was based our custom dataset, we use roboflow API for label and automatically download our dataset 

# Train 
by obvious reason, i got the best resutls using yolov5x weights but their also slower than yolov5s when i was running on my CPU 

# Robot Mechanical Structure

The robot was assembled using a Pololu frame. It is a compact sized track-type chassis with the possibility of customization. It is made of plastic, has a compartment for 4 AA batteries and holes for different types of shield accessories.

but the struture presented here is the Giovanni Bauermeister upgrated design on his great article on <a href="https://www.embarcados.com.br/mini-robo-com-camera-e-raspberry-pi-zero-w/">embarcados</a>

The main board, the brain of the robot, consists of a Raspberry Pi zero W with a Cortex ARM processor and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. As it is a board that runs Linux operating system, it is possible to develop in C/C++, Python, Node.js among other languages.
